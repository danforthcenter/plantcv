## Parallel workflow configuration class

`WorkflowConfig` is a class that stores parallel workflow configuration parameters. Configurations can be saved/imported
to run workflows in parallel.

### Quick start

Create a configuration file from a template:

```bash
plantcv-workflow.py --template my_config.txt
```

*class* **plantcv.parallel.WorkflowConfig**

### Class methods

Save a configuration file that can be modified and imported to run workflows in parallel.

**WorkflowConfig.save_config**(*config_file*)

- **Parameters:**
    - config_file (str, required): path/name of output configuration file
- **Context:**
    - Used to create a configuration file that can be edited and imported

Import a configuration file.

**WorkflowConfig.import_config**(*config_file*)

- **Parameters:**
    - config_file (str, required): path/name of input configuration file
- **Context:**
    - Used to import configuration settings from a file

Validate parameters/structure of configuration data.

**WorkflowConfig.validate_config**()

- **Parameters:**
    - None
- **Context:**
    - Used to run validation checks on configuration settings

### Attributes

* **input_dir**: (str, required): path/name of input images directory (validates that it exists).


* **json**: (str, required): path/name of output JSON data file (appends new data if it already exists).


* **filename_metadata**: (list, required): list of metadata terms used to construct filenames. for example: 
`["plantbarcode","timestamp"]`. Supported metadata terms are listed [here](pipeline_parallel.md).


* **workflow**: (str, required): path/name of user-defined PlantCV workflow Python script (validates that it exists).


* **include_all_subdirs**: (bool, default = `True`): If `False`, only images directly in `input_dir` (no 
  subdirectories) will be analyzed.


* **img_outdir**: (str, default = "."): path/name of output directory where images will be saved.


* **tmp_dir**: (str, default = `None`): path/name of parent folder for the temporary directory, uses system default
  temporary directory when `None`.


* **start_date**: (str, default = `None`): start date used to filter images. Images will be analyzed that are newer 
  than or equal to the start date. In the case of `None` all images prior to `end_date` are processed. String format
  should match `timestampformat`.


* **end_date**: (str, default = `None`): end date used to filter images. Images will be analyzed that are older than 
  or equal to the end date. In the case of `None` all images after `start_date` are processed. String format should match 
  `timestampformat`.


* **imgformat**: (str, default = "png"): image file format/extension.


* **delimiter**: (str, default = "_"): image filename metadata term delimiter character. Alternatively, a regular 
  expression for parsing filename metadata.


* **metadata_filters**: (dict, default = `None`): a dictionary of metadata terms (keys) and values, images will be 
  analyzed that have the associated term and value. A list of accepted values can be included. (e.g. 
  `{"imgtype": "VIS", "frame": ["0", "90"]"}`).


* **timestampformat**: (str, default = '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'): a date format code compatible with strptime C library. 
  See [strptime docs](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior) for supported 
  codes.


* **writeimg**: (bool, default = `False`): save analysis images to `img_outdir` if `True`.


* **other_args**: (dict, default = `{}`): dictionary of other argument keywords and values required by the workflow (e.g.
  `{"input1": "value1", "input2": "value2"}`).


* **groupby** (list, default = `["filepath"]`): a list of one or more metadata terms used to create unique groups of images
for downstream analysis. The default, `filepath` will create groups of single images (i.e. one input image per workflow). An
example of a multi-image group could be to pair VIS and NIR images (e.g. `["timestamp", "camera", "rotation"]`). Supported
metadata terms are listed [here](pipeline_parallel.md).

* **group_name** (str, default = `"imgtype"`): either a metadata term used to create a unique name for each image in an
image group (created by `groupby`), or `"auto"` to generate a numbered image sequence `image1, image2, ...`. The resulting
names are used to access individual image filepaths in a workflow.

* **cleanup**: (bool, default =`True`): remove temporary job directory if `True`.


* **append**: (bool, default = `True`): if `True` will append results to an existing json file. If `False`, will delete
  previous results stored in the specified JSON file.


* **cluster** (str, default = "LocalCluster"): LocalCluster will run PlantCV workflows on a single machine. All valid
  options currently are: "LocalCluster", "HTCondorCluster", "LSFCluster", "MoabCluster", "OARCluster", "PBSCluster",
  "SGECluster", and "SLURMCluster". See [Dask-Jobqueue](https://jobqueue.dask.org/) for more details.


* **cluster_config**: (dict, default: see below ): a dictionary of parameters and values used to configure the cluster
  for parallel processing locally or remotely.


* **metadata_terms**: (dict, default: as-is): a dictionary of metadata terms used to assign values in image filenames
  (or metadata files) to metadata terms (should not be modified).


### Cluster configuration

[Dask](https://dask.org/) is used to parallelize PlantCV image analysis workflows using both `dask.distributed` and 
`dask_jobqueue`. In Dask a cluster is a type of computing environment, which could either be local or a remote resource
(in this case a computing cluster managed by a scheduler).

First, we need to define the type of cluster to use. `LocalCluster` is the simplest setup and creates a pool of 
computing resources on the machine where we will run the `plantcv.parallel` functions.

!!! note
    The concept of "local" and "remote" is relative to the PlantCV program, not the user. In other words, LocalCluster
    could be used to run PlantCV on a single remote machine if this task were submitted to a remote computing environment
    (e.g. cloud, campus cluster, etc.). This is the standard approach PlantCV has used in older versions.

All other currently supported cluster types listed above allow the user to configure PlantCV to interface with a job
scheduling platform and distribute image analysis workflows across a computing resource (e.g. campus cluster).

!!! warning
    The cluster name supplied to the `cluster` setting must match one of the keywords above exactly (case-sensitive).

After defining the cluster, parameters are used to define the size of and request resources from the given computing 
environment. These settings are defined in the `cluster_config` parameter. We define by default the following 
parameters:

**n_workers**: (int, required, default = 1): the number of workers/slots to request from the cluster. Because we 
generally use 1 CPU per image analysis workflow, this is effectively the maximum number of concurrently running 
workflows.

**cores**: (int, required, default = 1): the number of compute cores per workflow. This should be left as 1 unless a 
workflow is designed to use multiple CPUs/cores/threads.

**memory**: (str, required, default = "1GB"): the amount of memory/RAM used per workflow. Can be set as a number plus 
units (KB, MB, GB, etc.).

**disk**: (str, required, default = "1GB"): the amount of disk space used per workflow. Can be set as a number plus 
units (KB, MB, GB, etc.).

**log_directory**: (str, optional, default = `None`): directory where worker logs are stored. Can be set to a path or 
environmental variable.

**local_directory**: (str, optional, default = `None`): dask working directory location. Can be set to a path or 
environmental variable.

**job_extra**: (dict, optional, default = `None`): extra parameters sent to the scheduler. Specified as a dictionary 
of key-value pairs (e.g. `{"getenv": "true"}`).

!!! note
    `n_workers` is the only parameter used by `LocalCluster`, all others are currently ignored. `n_workers`, `cores`,
    `memory`, and `disk` are required by the other clusters. All other parameters are optional. Additional parameters
    defined in the [dask-jobqueu API](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/api.html) can be supplied.

### Example

```python
import plantcv.parallel

# Create a WorkflowConfig instance
config = plantcv.parallel.WorkflowConfig()

#if you want to reuse a configuration file you can import it after creating an instance
config.import_config(config_file="my_config.json")

# Change configuration values directly in Python as needed. At a minimum you must specify input_dir, json, filename_metadata, workflow.
config.input_dir = "./my_images"
config.json = "output.json"
config.filename_metadata = ["plantbarcode", "timestamp"]
config.workflow = "my_workflow.py"

# Check for errors
config.validate_config()

# If it passes, save your configuration
config.save_config(config_file="my_config.json")
```

You may also edit your configuration file directly in a text editor, just remember that JSON syntax applies. 
See [Workflow Parallization tutorial for examples](pipeline_parallel.md)

To run `plantcv-workflow.py` with a config file you can use the following:

```shell
plantcv-workflow.py --config my_config.json
```

Remember that `python` and `plantcv-workflow.py` need to be in your PATH, for example with Conda environment. On 
Windows you will need to specify the whole path to `plantcv-workflow.py`.

```shell
python %CONDA_PREFIX%/Scripts/plantcv-workflow.py --config my_config.json
```
