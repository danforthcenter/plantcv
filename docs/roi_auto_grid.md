## Create a Grid of Circular Regions of Interest (ROI) Automatically

**plantcv.roi.auto_grid**(*mask, nrows, ncols, radius=None, img=None*)

**returns** roi_objects

- **Parameters:**
    - mask           = A binary mask.
    - nrows          = Number of rows in ROI layout.
    - ncols          = Number of columns in ROI layout.
    - radius         = Optional parameter to specify the radius of the ROIs.
    - img            = Optional Image from which the binary mask was created.
- **Context:**
    - Used to define a grid of multiple circular regions of interest in the same binary mask. Users
      specify a number of rows and columns, and the function detects a grid of circular ROIs based
      on the inputs. A custom radius can optionally be set for the individual circles. If the image from
      which the binary mask was created is passed as an argument, ROIs will be drawn on that image if
      debug is set to plot. Otherwise, they will be drawn on the binary mask. Returns an Objects
      dataclass that can be used in downstream steps. It is not necessary for there to be a plant
      in every grid cell, just that the objects follow a general grid structure and that there is at
      least one object in each row and column. Similar to the [pcv.roi.multi](roi_multi.md) function.

```python

from plantcv import plantcv as pcv

# Set global debug behavior to None (default), "print" (to file), 
# or "plot" (Jupyter Notebooks or X11)
pcv.params.debug = "print"

# Make a grid of ROIs 
rois = pcv.roi.auto_grid(mask=mask, nrows=3, ncols=6, radius=20, img=img)

```

### Next steps:

This function returns an Objects dataclass, which can be used with [create_labels](create_labels.md) to createa a labeled
mask for use with analysis functions.

```python

lbl_mask, n_lbls = pcv.create_labels(mask=mask, rois=rois)

# Analyze the shape of each plant 
shape_img = pcv.analyze.size(img=img_copy, labeled_mask=lbl_mask, n_labels=n_lbls, label="plant")

# Print out a text file with shape data for each plant in the image 
pcv.outputs.save_results(filename=filename)

```
