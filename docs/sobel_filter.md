## Sobel Filter

This is a filtering method used to identify and highlight coarse changes in pixel intensity based on the 1st derivative.
Similar results to the [Scharr filter](scharr_filter.md) function.

**plantcv.sobel_filter**(*gray_img, dx, dy, ksize, roi=None*)

**returns** filtered image

- **Parameters:**
    - gray_img - Grayscale image data
    - dx - derivative of x to analyze
    - dy - derivative of y to analyze
    - ksize - apertures size used to calculate 2nd derivative filter, specifies the size of the kernel (must be an odd integer)
	- roi - Optional rectangular ROI as returned by [`pcv.roi.rectangle`](roi_rectangle.md) within which to apply this function. (default = None, which uses the entire image)
- **Context:**
    - Used to define edges within and around objects
    - Aperture size must be greater than the largest derivative (`ksize >= dx & ksize >= dy`) in order to run
- **Example use:**
    - Below

```python
from plantcv import plantcv as pcv

# Set global debug behavior to None (default), "print" (to file),
# or "plot" (Jupyter Notebooks or X11)
pcv.params.debug = "plot"

# Filtered image will highlight areas of coarse pixel 
# intensity change based on 1st derivative
sb_x_img = pcv.sobel_filter(gray_img=gray_img, dx=1, dy=0, ksize=1)
sb_y_img = pcv.sobel_filter(gray_img=gray_img, dx=0, dy=1, ksize=1)
