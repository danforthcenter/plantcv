### PlantCV utilities

`plantcv-utils` is a command-line tool for running various utilities.

**Source Code:** [Here](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/blob/main/plantcv/utils/cli.py)


#### Convert output JSON data files to CSV tables

`plantcv-utils json2csv` is a command-line tool for converting the output JSON files from `plantcv-run-workflow` to
CSV-formatted tables for downstream analysis in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), 
[MVApp](https://mvapp.kaust.edu.sa/), or other programs. For example, [pcvr](https://danforthcenter.github.io/pcvr/) provides R functions for use with PlantCV output or other phenotype data for Bayesian statistics and non-linear modeling.

```
usage: plantcv-utils json2csv [-h] -j JSON -c CSV

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -j JSON, --json JSON  Input PlantCV JSON filename.
  -c CSV, --csv CSV     Output CSV file prefix.

```

The input JSON file is generally created by running `plantcv-run-workflow`, although there are some advanced scenarios
where it is created by running `plantcv.parallel.process_results` on a directory of JSON files. This 
[hierarchical data structure](output_measurements.md) is convenient for flexible data processing but not for downstream
analysis. The tool creates two output CSV files. The format of the `single-value-traits.csv` file is in wide format, with
a column per trait (traits represented by single values). The format of the `multi-value-traits.csv` file is one row per
value/label (i.e. long format).

#### Tabulate Naive Bayes Classes

`plantcv-utils tabulate_bayes_classes` is a command-line tool for organizing pixel RGB values into a table for naive Bayes
training with the command. 

```
usage: plantcv-utils tabulate_bayes_classes [-h] -i INFILE -o OUTFILE

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INFILE, --infile INFILE
                        Input text file.
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        Output tab-delimited table file.

```

The input file should have class names preceded by the "#" character. RGB values can be pasted directly from ImageJ without
reformatting. E.g.:

```
#plant
96,154,72	95,153,72	91,155,71	91,160,70	90,155,67	92,152,66	92,157,70
54,104,39	56,104,38	59,106,41	57,105,43	54,104,40	54,103,35	56,101,39	58,99,41	59,99,41
#background
114,127,121	117,135,125	120,137,131	132,145,138	142,154,148	151,166,158	160,182,172
115,125,121	118,131,123	122,132,135	133,142,144	141,151,152	150,166,158	159,179,172

```

#### Collect a random sample of images for testing workflows

`plantcv-utils sample_images` is a command-line tool for gathering a random set of images for
testing workflows before running over a full image set. 

```
usage: plantcv-utils sample_images [-h] -s SOURCE_DIRECTORY -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY -n NUMBER

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                                      Show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCE_DIRECTORY, --source SOURCE_DIRECTORY  Input image directory.
  -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --outdir OUTPUT_DIRECTORY  Output directory.
  -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER                      Number of images to randomly select. (default=100)

```

Testing a workflow on small test set (that ideally spans time and/or treatments) can speed up workflow optimization and 
test it on other images in the dataset to determine how robust the workflow will be. The random image sampler can help 
identify 'problem images' before running a workflow in parallel over a large set of images. This
tool can handle LemnaTec structured output in addition to a flat file directory. Currently supported image types include 
.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tif, .tiff, and .gif. An output directory will be created if it does not already exist. The number of 
random images requested must be less than or equal to the number of images in the source directory. 

**Source Code:** [Here](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/blob/main/plantcv/utils/sample_images.py)


### Parallel workflow processing

`plantcv-run-workflow` is a command-line tool for parallel processing of user-defined PlantCV workflows. It is used to
process metadata and execute custom workflows on each image in a dataset. More detail is provided in the 
[Workflow Parallelization Tutorial](pipeline_parallel.md).
