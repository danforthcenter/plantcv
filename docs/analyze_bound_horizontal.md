## Horizontal Boundary Line Tool

Set boundary line with boundary tool, this allows the user to find the extent-y ('height')
above and below as well as the area above and below the boundary line. This tool functions 
best if the pot size/position of the plant remains relatively constant.
 
**analyze_bound_horizontal**(*img, obj, mask, line_position, device , debug=None, filename=False*)

**returns** device, boundary headers, boundary data, image with boundary data

- **Parameters:**
    - img - image object (most likely the original), color(RGB)
    - obj - single or grouped contour object
    - mask - binary mask of selected contours
    - line_position = position of boundary line (a value of 0 would draw the line through the bottom of the image)
    - device - Counter for image processing steps
    - debug - None, "print", or "plot". Print = save to file, Plot = print to screen. Default = None
    - filename - False or image name. If defined print image
- **Context:**
    - Used to define a boundary line for the image, to find the height above and below as well as area above and below a boundary line.
    - Could also be used as a method of flagging images about to go out-of-bounds (this QC tool will be added later)
- **Example use:**
    - [Use In VIS Tutorial](vis_tutorial.md)

**Output Data Units:** 
    - Y-Position - Height of the bound line used for measurement (height from bottom of image), pixels (units)  
    - Height-Above-Bound - Extent-y of object above bound line, pixels (units)  
    - Height-Below-Bound - Extent-y of object below bound line, pixels (units)  
    - Area-Above-Bound - area of object above bound line, pixels (units)  
    - Area-Below-Bound - area of object below bound line, pixels (units)  
    - Percent-Above-Bound - percentage of total area above the bound line  
    - Percent-Below-Bound - percentage of total area below the bound line  

```python
import plantcv as pcv

# Set Boundary Line    
device, boundary_header, boundary_data, boundary_img1 = pcv.analyze_bound_horizontal(img, obj, mask, 950, device, debug='print', 'setaria_boundary_img.png')
```

**Boundary tool output image (y = 950)**

![Screenshot](img/documentation_images/analyze_bound_horizontal/boundary_950.jpg)

Boundary line set at 950, purple line is boundary line, blue line is extent y above boundary line, 
green is area above boundary line.

**Boundary tool output image (y = 330)**

![Screenshot](img/documentation_images/analyze_bound_horizontal/boundary_330.jpg)

Boundary line set at 330, purple is boundary line, blue line is extent y above boundary line, 
green line is extent y below boundary line, green is area above boundary line and red is area below boundary line.
