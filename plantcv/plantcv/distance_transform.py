def distance_transform(bin_img, distance_type, mask_size):
    """Creates an image where for each object pixel, a number is assigned that corresponds to the distance to the
    nearest background pixel.

    Inputs:
    img             = Binary image data
    distance_type   = Type of distance. It can be CV_DIST_L1, CV_DIST_L2 , or CV_DIST_C which are 1, 2 and 3,
                      respectively.
    mask_size       = Size of the distance transform mask. It can be 3, 5, or CV_DIST_MASK_PRECISE (the latter option
                      is only supported by the first function). In case of the CV_DIST_L1 or CV_DIST_C distance type,
                      the parameter is forced to 3 because a 3 by 3 mask gives the same result as 5 by 5 or any larger
                      aperture.

    Returns:
    norm_image      = grayscale distance-transformed image normalized between [0, 1]
