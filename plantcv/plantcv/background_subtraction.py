def background_subtraction(background_image, foreground_image):
    """
    Creates a binary image from a background subtraction of the foreground using cv2.BackgroundSubtractorMOG().
    The binary image returned is a mask that should contain mostly foreground pixels.
    The background image should be the same background as the foreground image except not containing the object
    of interest.

    Images must be of the same size and type.
    If not, larger image will be taken and downsampled to smaller image size.
    If they are of different types, an error will occur.

    Inputs:
    background_image       = img object, RGB or binary/grayscale/single-channel
    foreground_image       = img object, RGB or binary/grayscale/single-channel

    Returns:
    fgmask                 = background subtracted foreground image (mask)
