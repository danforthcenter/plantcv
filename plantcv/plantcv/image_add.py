    This is a function used to add images. The numpy addition function '+' is used. This is a modulo operation
       rather than the cv2.add fxn which is a saturation operation. ddepth = -1 specifies that the dimensions of output
       image will be the same as the input image.

    Inputs:
    gray_img1      = Grayscale image data to be added to image 2
    gray_img2      = Grayscale image data to be added to image 1
